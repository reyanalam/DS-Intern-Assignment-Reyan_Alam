## Problem Overview

You've been hired as a data scientist for SmartManufacture Inc., a leading industrial automation company. The company has deployed an extensive sensor network throughout one of their client's manufacturing facilities to monitor environmental conditions and energy usage.

The client is concerned about the increasing energy costs associated with their manufacturing equipment. They want to implement a predictive system that can forecast equipment energy consumption based on various environmental factors and sensor readings from different zones of the factory.

## Your Task

Your assignment is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the energy consumption of industrial equipment (`equipment_energy_consumption`) based on the data collected from the factory's sensor network. This will help the facility managers optimize their operations for energy efficiency and cost reduction.

### Specific Goals:

1. Analyze the provided sensor data to identify patterns and relationships between environmental factors and equipment energy consumption
2. Build a robust regression model to predict equipment energy consumption
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics
4. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing energy consumption

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── data/               # Contains the training and test datasets
│   ├── data.csv        # dataset
├── docs/               # Documentation files
│   └── data_description.md  # Detailed description of all features
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Dataset Description

The data comes from a manufacturing facility equipped with multiple sensors that collect environmental measurements. Each record contains:

- Timestamp of the measurement
- Energy consumption readings for equipment and lighting
- Temperature and humidity readings from 9 different zones in the facility
- Outdoor weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Additional measurements and calculated variables

### Notes on Feature Selection and Random Variables

The dataset includes two variables named `random_variable1` and `random_variable2`. Part of your task is to determine, through proper data analysis and feature selection techniques, whether these variables should be included in your model or not. This mimics real-world scenarios where not all available data is necessarily useful for prediction.

Your approach to handling these variables should be clearly documented and justified in your analysis. This will be an important part of evaluating your feature selection methodology.

Note that your final solution will also be evaluated on a separate holdout dataset that we maintain privately, which serves as an additional check on your model's generalization capability.

For a detailed description of all features, please refer to the [data description document](docs/data_description.md).

## Deliverables
